 Omnivore provides labels (also known as tags) to help you organize your library. Labels can be added to any saved read, and your library can be filtered based on labels. 

 On the web if you have a larger screen you can find the labels tool on the left side of the screen.

 Adding a label from the left menu 

 For a smaller screen you will find the labels button at the top of the page.

 Editing labels from the library view on iOS 

##  Label searches on iOS 

 On iOS you can use the label search modal to search for specific labels. This will create an OR search and return all links matching the assigned labels.

 Using labels to filter your search 

##  Using Advanced Search to filter your library with labels 

 Omnivore's advanced search syntax supports searching for multiple labels using AND and OR clauses. You can also negate a label search to find pages that do not have a certain label. 

 Some examples: 

* `label:Newsletter` finds all pages that have the label Newsletter
* `label:Cooking,Fitness` finds all your pages with either the Cooking or Fitness labels
* `label:Newsletter label:Surfing` finds all pages with both the Newsletter and Surfing labels
* l`abel:Coding -label:News` finds all pages with the Coding label that do not have the News label
