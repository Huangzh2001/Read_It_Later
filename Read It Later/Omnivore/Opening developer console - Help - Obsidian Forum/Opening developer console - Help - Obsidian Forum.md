### [](#what-im-trying-to-do-1)What I’m trying to do

I need to fill a bug ticket for a plugin I use, but they’re asking for developer console error log.  
But I do not know how to open it and there is - to my knowledge - no shortcut listed in the Settings panel.

macOS → `cmd+option+i`  
Windows → `ctrl+shift+i`

The **Console** tab at the top should do it. Sometimes it’s already visible on the lower right.

For me the Dev Tools doesn’t open with this command. Can you post a Screenshot how it should look?  
I would like to make some CSS style and get the element tag, but I can’t get the tool open.  
Did they remove it in the new version?

You should be able to open if from the obsidian menu:

View > Toggle Developer Tools

How to get the view option? If I open the options, there is only a toggle reading view option. I’m using windows and there are no options on the top as on Mac.

Maybe I understand the developer tool wrong. Are they like the F12 options in the browser?

Ok I found it!

Normally the options are hidden. But when you go to Settings → Appearance → ‘Window frame style’ and change there from “hidden (default)” to “Obsidian frame” than there is the Menu where I can change like you told me. After the relaunch everything is visible. S

Thanks for that!
