The big thing here seems to be Right To Left language support. I take it for granted writing left to right, but this is a huge update for the RTL parts of the world. 

That said, here are a few things from 1.6 I wanted to share with you...

## My feature request from three years ago has been implemented

![[Omnivore/Fw- Obsidian 1.6 + Second Brain Summit/attachments/5dbad3d35028a1fe150ee76fffdec070_MD5.jpg]]

_Solved!_

Well, officially it's solved. I did a quick test and had some funky behavior.

Since this isn't the official release, I'm sure there are a few bugs or edge cases like this one to still be aware of.

## Hide the ribbon

I'm curious, do you use the ribbon on the left? I don't. But I'm really curious if you do. [Email me back "I use the ribbon" if you do.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8ug22l3e6iqhkvmql8bvhp6eorrrho/g3hnh5h3g9v7z8hr/bWFpbHRvOmhlbGxvQGxpbmtpbmd5b3VydGhpbmtpbmcuY29t) 

![[Omnivore/Fw- Obsidian 1.6 + Second Brain Summit/attachments/4463907bbd2101e4498ae546df3490da_MD5.jpg]]

Just right-click on the ribbon to see your options.

Also, you can toggle the ribbon in Settings > Appearance. I just turned it off and I must admit, I feel naked now...I'll get used to the breeze, though. It's worth it for the extra real estate.

## Way easier to remember and open vaults

![[Omnivore/Fw- Obsidian 1.6 + Second Brain Summit/attachments/7bfc55da7a78a4facb8dc021ab38a3e9_MD5.jpg]]

Now it's much easier to open other vaults...like the LYT Teambase

## We now have a smarter word counter

This is a small touch but I'm so happy about it.

## Join me at the Second Brain Summit

We are just four days away from ticket sales opening for the Second Brain Summit. 

I know from a very good source that there are more people on the waitlist than there are available tickets. 

Here's what you need to know:

* â€‹[Make sure you've already joined the waitlist.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8ug22l3e6iqhkvmql8bvhp6eorrrho/9qhzhnhp4w7k2os9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVpbGRpbmdhc2Vjb25kYnJhaW4uY29tL3N1bW1pdA==)â€‹
* Tickets officially go on sale at 6am pacific time on Tues 5/14
* Here's the current lineup...

![[Omnivore/Fw- Obsidian 1.6 + Second Brain Summit/attachments/893adda1c253789798a2da047cd1f01b_MD5.jpg]]

Having gone to other in person events recently, I now actively seek them out. They fill me up. I cannot emphasize enough the impact that in-person events have on the deepest parts of me. And I'm an introvert. I strongly encourage you to join us there. It's like, finally, a group of people who care about the same stuff I do, who think about the same problems I do, even if it's in wildly different fields and careers.

## Writing Original Works

Don't worry, enrollment is closed. Just a quick recap. Between our Knowledge Accelerator people and new enrollees, we have 286 participants.

## Winner of the Golden Ticket: Alex Pinegger 

During our public eventâ€”[Livewriting 101](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8ug22l3e6iqhkvmql8bvhp6eorrrho/3ohphkh7xmw6dpbr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2luZ3lvdXJ0aGlua2luZy5jb20vcmF3LXJlY29yZGluZ3MvbGl2ZXdyaXRpbmctMTAx)â€”we picked a winner to attend WOW for free. All they had to do was share their mini essay (you can see how that looked at the 51:00 minute mark). We're happy to have Alex be a part of the WOW workshop.

## What designing an online experience looks like

Yesterday, I was designing the WOW experience and wanted to share a sneak peek into cohort design...

I know about 95% of what I want to cover, but there is still a lot of work to do in creating the conditions of an experience that can lead to transformations small and large. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on how to pepper in lessons from the curriculum into the first two live sessions, but itâ€™s not a one-way street, because the exercises in the live sessions affect which lessons will unlock in the first wave of the curriculum. It requires all my focus. I enjoy it. I think Iâ€™m good at it. But it also means everything else in life is put on hold. 

Here's a glimpse of what some of that looks like.

![[Omnivore/Fw- Obsidian 1.6 + Second Brain Summit/attachments/eda7f9b8b71814ff16e52d2a46b13e44_MD5.jpg]]

I'll using Obsidian Canvas. It works. It is a bit sluggish. But it works.

All the curriculum lessons are at the bottom. Then I'll migrate (by duplicating) the ones I'm covering in Week 1â€”placing them in my live "super" and "workflow" sessions. The red cards are exercises exclusively for the live sessions that don't show up in the curriculum. 

Hope that might be interesting for you.

**ðŸ‘£ Footnotes ðŸŽµ**

The noise ðŸ’¥ is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal ðŸŒ¿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

â€¢ how to think better and with more joy

â€¢ how to be a better _**notemaker**_ instead of just a notetaker

â€¢ getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions

â€¢ spotlighting ðŸ”¦ people and ideas that have stood the test of time âœ¨
