## About this book

 This book is an introductory textbook on the statistical mechanics of poly­ mers and complex fluids aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate stu­ dents and non-specialist researchers who are starting research in this field. Modern statistical mechanics on polymers and complex fluids is based on many fields, such as chemical physics, statistical mechanics, quantum me­ chanics, stochastic processes, theory of phase transitions, hydrodynamics, rheology, and so on. This book provides an overview of the basic concepts and methods used in current research on the physics of polymers and complex fluids. Using simple but essential examples, we describe how to derive the physical properties of polymers theoretically, focusing on the structure and dynamics on mesoscopic scales. Here, the term 'mesoscopic scales' means intermediate lengths and time scales between the microscopic atomic scale and the macroscopic scale. Properties on mesoscopic scales are the central issue of the physics of polymers and complex fluids, because these materials are well characterized by spatiotemporal structures on these scales, where we can extract universal properties that are independent of the microscopic details of the system.

## Reviews

From the reviews:

"Kawakatsu (Tohoku Univ., Japan) introduces the theoretical work behind the statistical mechanics of polymers and complex fluids. … The author uses frequent examples to reinforce the results of the derivations. … Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through faculty." (E. Kincanon, CHOICE, Vol. 42 (5), January, 2005)

"The author does a fine job with this challenging material. The text is concise, logical and written with a clarity that is particularly impressive … . It is complemented by a wealth of figures … . Intended as a teaching aid rather than a comprehensive survey, the volume is well suited to its target audience of graduate and advanced undergraduate students with physics backgrounds. However, it is also likely to be valuable to a wider readership of polymer chemists and engineers … ." (A Uhlherr, Polymer International, Issue: 54, 2005)

"This particular book … was conceived as an introduction to the concepts as well as theoretical methods used in contemporary research in the physics of polymers and complex fluids. … All in all this is an interesting and useful book. … this book seems to be almost a perfect basis for an advanced graduate course of polymer physics and I would certainly recommend it as such." (R. Podgornik, Journal of Statistical Physics, Vol. 122 (2), 2006)
